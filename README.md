## PokeInfo

Poke info is a site set up to connect to a pokemon showdown battle and display real time information about the pokemon in the battle.

## How I worked on this project

## How to navigate this project

- useWebsocket
- Data fetching

## Why I built the project this way

- I used Vite as an alternative to create-react-app for a more lightweight application
- I utilized typescript to help with future proofing my application and allowing for easier error handling down the line
- I used websockets to connect with the showdown server to allow for fast reliable data access.

## If I had more time I would change this

- Better integration with the Dex types provided by @pkmn/types
- add more testing
- add a damage calculator
